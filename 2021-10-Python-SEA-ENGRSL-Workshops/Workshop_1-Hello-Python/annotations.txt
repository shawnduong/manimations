Made possible by SEA x ENGRSL.
Intro, big picture, why Py, logic, conditionals, loops, functions.
Goal: learn programming, fly drones.
Day 1: basic fundamentals.
Day 2: more Python, intro to Tello.
Day 3: more Python, more drones.
Starts with people.
We want stuff done.
We have to work for it.
-
Computers do work.
Computers understand binary.
We write source.
Syntax - the way we write things; semantics - what they mean.
Simple and intuitive.
Low learning curve.
Interpreted.
Like a piano.
Python 3.7+.
Logic activity.
Logic = fundamental basis.
Preheat oven to 175 C.
Cream together butter and sugar.
Beat in eggs.
Stir in vanilla and baking soda.
Stir in flour and chocolate chips.
Drop by spoonfuls into baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes.
This is an example of a linear program.
Go to the first battery.
If it is powered on, go to step 3. Else, step 4.
Record the charge and go to step 5.
Turn the battery on and go to step 5.
If there is a next battery, repeat steps 2-5 for it.
This is an example of a non-linear program.
Control flow structures, logical structures.
If then.
Else.
Else if.
Else if.
Conditionals intuition.
Conditionals demo.
Conditionals activity.
What if we want to do something N many times?
There has to be an easier way!
While.
For x in y.
For x in range(N).
Loops intuition.
Loops demo.
Loops activity.
What if there are chunks of code that we have to use in multiple places?
We can define it as a function!
We'll talk more about this in-depth next week, also this code is incomplete.
Functions intuition.
Functions demo.
Functions activity.
Puzzles activity.
Let's wake up Tello!
Drone has front camera, spawns wireless network, broadcasts SSID.
API abstracts, uses OOP, makes life easier.
Wake up, Tello! activity.
